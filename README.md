This is a simple Stopwatch program written in C++ that allows the user to input hours, minutes, and seconds, and then counts down to zero. The program is primarily designed to run on Windows, using Sleep() to pause for one second and system("cls") to clear the console screen. The user can enter any duration, and the countdown is displayed in the familiar HH:MM:SS format, updating every second until the timer reaches zero. When the countdown finishes, the program displays a clear "Time Out" message.
To run this program on Windows, make sure you have a C++ compiler such as MinGW or Visual Studio installed. Copy the code into a .cpp file, compile it using g++ stopwatch.cpp -o stopwatch.exe, and then run it with ./stopwatch.exe. Enter the hours, minutes, and seconds when prompted, and watch the countdown in the console. For users who prefer to run the program online without installing a compiler, you can view and execute the code directly using [Stopwatch on OnlineGDB
